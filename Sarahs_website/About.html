                <p class="paragraph_style_1">At age 3, Sarah Hoch decided to be the next Madonna. She has been working towards that goal ever since. Although a few small edits have been made (mainly the huge addition of a Broadway stage), the dream is alive and kicking. Currently residing in Chicago, Sarah is constantly involving herself in anything she can get her hands on: musicals, plays, cabarets, commercials, film - even as the lead singer of with her someday band the Whiskey Punch Club. She works countless random jobs to survive - always keeping things flexible so she can make her craft her number one priority.
                <br /><br/></p><p class="paragraph_style_1">
                Sarah grew up in the quaint, small-ish town of Westford, MA, where her high school theatre program laid a solid foundation of acting and singing for the stage. As a small child, her gravitation towards performance had not yet been articulated in her mind, but as she learned and grew, Sarah discovered the innate power of story-telling. She realized that theatre creates the one thing that connects us all as a human race: empathy. She decided that it was her life's calling to give that to the world, and she began the college audition process.
                <br /><br/></p><p class="paragraph_style_1">

                With the guidance of mentors Luke Jorgensen, Michael Towers, and her wonderful mother, she earned a scholarship and began studying Musical Theatre at Drake University. Christine Fortner-Blanner, her voice teacher, helped her develop her uniquely warm, simultaneously bright sound, and Karla Kash, the head of her MT department, showered her with individual coaching time, Laban technique, Shakespeare, and many other tools - all of which landed her an internship at Playhouse on the Square in Memphis, TN. Excited for a new adventure, Sarah moved there as soon as she graduated with her BFA in Musical Theatre in May of 2011. Her time at Playhouse on the Square was pretty much another four year education crammed into thirteen months. She learned just how specific she needed to be both physically and vocally, developing characters that ranged from temptress to buffoon - from wide eyed adolescent to her very first pants role. She even somehow had time to fall in love with puppetry. By the end of her internship, she was ready to move to Chicago and try to make it in what seemed like a terrifying/exciting industry.
                <br /><br/></p><p class="paragraph_style_1">

                Now thriving in the Windy City, Sarah works consistently with multiple theatre companies. She is an artistic associate for Underscore Theatre, with whom she has become a seasoned role-originator in multiple new musicals. She also performs year-round in cabarets, musical murder mysteries, corporate events and as a Christmas caroler during the holiday season with the Chicago Cabaret Project. She has created two solo cabarets, and taken on her largest role ever - Charity in Sweet Charity - with MadKap Productions. She also recently signed with two agencies, Ambassador Talent and Planet Earth Agency, and has begun auditioning in the commercial and print world.
                <br /><br/></p><p class="paragraph_style_1">

                People often ask why anyone would choose this crazy, free-lance, constantly-looking-for-the-next-job lifestyle - to which Sarah responds, "Anyone who loved something this much would do it. Some people lack that passion; I'm not one of them."<br /></p>
